### Why'd you want to do that?
I'm finishing my graduation in Computer Science by the half of this year and this replica is a part of my undergraduate thesis.

### Project objectives

My objective is to generate an JSON output of some scenarios meanwhile I play the game (speed, crash time, crash speed, distance when I jumped, etc) and write a genetic algorithm to generate the optimal output so the computer can play the game by itself.

The algorithms and the output will be commited to this same repository.

### Objectives Achieved
1. ![Done](http://u.cubeupload.com/victorferraresi/icodone.png) Creation of the Unity game replica
2. ![Done](http://u.cubeupload.com/victorferraresi/icodone.png) Generation of a JSON output of the played game scenario
3. ![Done](http://u.cubeupload.com/victorferraresi/icodone.png) Implementation of the genetic algorithm
4. ![WIP](http://u.cubeupload.com/victorferraresi/icowip.png) Enhancement of the Crossover and Mutation systems
