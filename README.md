## Why'd you want to do that?
I'm finishing my graduation in Computer Science by the half of this year and this replica is a part of my undergraduate thesis.

## Project objectives

My objective is to generate an JSON output of some scenarios meanwhile I play the game (speed, crash time, crash speed, distance when I jumped, etc) and write a genetic algorithm to generate the optimal output so the computer can play the game by itself.

The algorithms and the output will be commited to this same repository.
