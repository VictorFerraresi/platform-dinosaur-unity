### How do I run the project?
1. Clone this repository to your local machine (`git clone https://github.com/VictorFerraresi/platform-dinosaur-unity.git`)
2. Download and Install the [Unity Engine Development Kit](https://unity3d.com/pt/get-unity/download)
3. Open the Unity Engine and load the folder you just cloned as a Unity Project
4. Click on the play button!
5. Game Commands: Spacebar = JUMP.

By default, if there are less than 4 base genomes in the Genomes directory, the game will let you play by yourself and record your inputs until there are 4 base generated genomes. After that, the game will start playing by itself, doing CrossOvers and Mutations over your base Genomes, and calculating their Fitness using out Fitness Function.

### How does the genetic algorithm works?
By the moment you have 4 base genomes in the Genomes directory, the algorithm will generate another 12 Genomes doing [CrossOvers](#crossover-function) and [Mutations](#mutation-function) and will commit them to the Genomes/CrossedOvers directory. By doing that, the game will play all the 12 new genomes by itself, calculating their fitness using the Fitness Function.

After calculating their fitness, the algorithm will select the top 4 fitness (by greater value) and delete all the others. We'll have, again, 4 base genomes to operate over again and again, iteratively, until our Objective Function is achieved.

#### CrossOver function
It iterates over two genomes, cromossome by cromossome and randomically picks one of the 2 cromossomes and adds it to the new genome. Let's say we have Genome A as (X Y Z D E F) and Genome B as (H I J K L M). Their crossover result might me Genome C as (X Y J D L M).

#### Mutation function
It picks one single genome and adds a new random-controlled cromossome to it. It's random-controlled because it's values are random inside a range, that covers the average of the jumps distance of that entire genome plus a random factor between -1.0 and 0.0. Let's say we have a Genome A as (X Y Z D E F). It's mutation result might be Genome B (X Y Z D G E F)

### Why'd you want to do that?
I'm finishing my graduation in Computer Science by the half of this year and this replica is a part of my undergraduate thesis.

### Project objectives

My objective is to generate an JSON output of some scenarios meanwhile I play the game (speed, crash time, crash speed, distance when I jumped, etc) and write a genetic algorithm to generate the optimal output so the computer can play the game by itself.

The algorithms and the output will be commited to this same repository.
